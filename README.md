Linear Regression in R: Predicting Outcomes of Data

This project aims to demonstrate how to perform linear regression analysis in R using a small data set of 20 samples. Linear regression is a supervised machine learning technique that is used to predict a continuous outcome variable based on one or more predictor variables. It assumes that there is a linear relationship between the outcome and the predictors, and it estimates the coefficients of the regression equation that minimizes the error of the predictions.

The main goal of this project is to show how to calculate and interpret the correlation between the variables, the general formula of the linear regression model, and the hypothesis tests for the model and its coefficients.
